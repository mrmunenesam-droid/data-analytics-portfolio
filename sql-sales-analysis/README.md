# SQL Sales Analysis (PostgreSQL)

## Problem
The objective was to analyze sales performance and identify revenue trends across products, regions, and customers.

## Dataset
A sample sales dataset provided in CSV format and imported into PostgreSQL for analysis. The dataset was designed to demonstrate SQL query logic, aggregations, and time-based analysis.
The focus of this project is on query structure and analytical reasoning rather than dataset size.



## Tools Used
- PostgreSQL
- pgAdmin

## Analysis Performed
- Calculated total revenue by product
- Analyzed sales performance by region
- Identified top customers by revenue
- Evaluated monthly sales trends


## Outcome
The analysis provided clear insights into top-performing products, high-revenue regions, and customer contribution to overall sales.
